## Deploy an app to production

To deploy an app to a production environment, your department, agency or team must have a [paid account](/get_started.html#trial-and-paid-accounts) with the GOV.UK PaaS.

Before you deploy an app to a production environment, you must set up a domain.

If you are a central government service using the GOV.UK domain, you must [get a domain from GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name) for your service and set the [DNS records required by your cdn-route service](/deploying_services/use_a_custom_domain/#set-up-a-cdn-route-service-with-one-or-more-custom-domains).

If you are using your own content distribution network (CDN), you must [set up a domain by configuring your CDN](/deploying_services/configure_cdn/#set-up-a-custom-domain-by-configuring-your-own-cdn).

You must also:

- build your app in line with the [12-factor app principles](/architecture.html#12-factor-application-principles)
- use a separate staging environment to test your app (refer to the [case studies on managing orgs, users and spaces](/orgs_spaces_users.html#case-studies) for more information)
- [configure an `http` health check](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html) to allow Cloud Foundry to detect and attempt to replace unhealthy app instances

When you deploy an app to a production environment, you should:

- [use zero downtime, rolling deploys](/get_started.html#deploying-with-zero-downtime)
- [run more than one instance of your app](/managing_apps.html#scaling) to make sure your app is always available
- select a high-availability plan for your app's [backing service](/deploying_services/#deploy-a-backing-or-routing-service) if your app uses a backing service
