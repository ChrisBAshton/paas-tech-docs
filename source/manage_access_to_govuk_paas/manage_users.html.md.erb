# Users and permissions

Users are members of your team who can access or manage apps and backing services on the PaaS.

Users are assigned roles which have different permissions for accessing and managing orgs and spaces. A user can have one or multiple roles within the same or different orgs and spaces.

To see a list of users and their roles in your org, you can view the appropriate org's __Members__ screen in the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for either the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) (requires sign in). Your user account must have the [org manager role](orgs_spaces_users.html#org-manager) or the [org auditor role](orgs_spaces_users.html#org-auditor) to see this information in the admin tool.

You can also run `cf org-users ORGNAME` to see a list of users and their roles in your org, where `ORGNAME` is the name of the org.

Although there are multiple roles, the 6 most common are:

- Org manager
- Org auditor
- Billing manager
- Space developer
- Space manager
- Space auditor

Refer to the [Cloud Foundry documentation on roles and permissions](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/roles.html#roles) for more information.

### Org manager

This role applies within an org.

Every org must have at least one org manager. Org managers are primary contacts for the org.

Org managers manage spaces, users and user roles, and approve org changes such as requesting new quotas and enabling paid services.

Org managers can use the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool to invite new users to an org, without needing to contact the GOV.UK PaaS team. This is possible for either the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) (requires sign in).

We create at least one user account with the org manager role as part of your onboarding process. We recommend you have at least 2 org managers in case one is unavailable.

If you need the org manager role added to a user account, contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

### Org auditor

This role applies within an org.

Org auditors can view user account information and org [quota](managing_apps.html#quotas) information, but cannot edit that information.

### Billing manager

This role applies within an org.

Billing managers create and manage billing account and payment information. They can also view users and roles using the command line, or the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for either the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) (requires sign in).

You should assign a billing manager to your org before your service moves to production. We will send all payment requests to the billing manager. An org manager can also be a billing manager.

Contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) if you have any questions.

### Space developer

This role applies within a space.

A space developer can deploy, run and manage apps, and create and bind services. This is the default role for any user who is not assigned a manager role.

For example, a space developer granted access to the testing space only can change apps in this space. However, that developer cannot do anything in the production space because they do not have access to this space.

### Space manager

This role applies within a space.

A space manager grants user roles within a space and can change space properties using the command line. A space manager cannot deploy, run, or manage apps or services.

For example, a team member needs to change apps in both the testing and production spaces, and manage users in the testing space. The org manager grants this team member the space manager role in the testing space, and the space developer role in both the testing and production spaces. That team member can add users to testing but not to production (as a space manager), and can change apps in both spaces (as a space developer).

### Space auditor

This role applies within a space.

Space auditors can view apps, users and resources used within a space using the command line, but cannot edit them. This role is useful for viewing app data without modifying it.
