# Task: Remove users from a space

When a team member leaves or stops working on a project, the org manager should revoke that team member’s access rights.

The org manager can use the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool to remove all of the team member’s user roles within the team’s spaces.

1. Sign in to the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for either the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/).
1. Select the appropriate org.
1. Select __View and manage team members__.
1. Select the appropriate user.
1. Change the user’s space roles and select __Save role changes__.

Alternatively, the org manager can run the following in the command line:

```
cf unset-space-role USERNAME ORGNAME SPACE ROLE
```

where:

- `USERNAME` is the email address the user signs in with when using the command line client
- `ORGNAME` is the name of the org
- `SPACE` is the name of the space
- `ROLE` is the user role granted to the user of the email address in the `USERNAME` field

For example, to remove ana@example.com's space developer role from the sandbox space within the acme org, the org manager would run:

```
cf unset-space-role ana@example.com acme sandbox SpaceDeveloper
```

Refer to the [Cloud Foundry reference guide on `cf unset-space-role`](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/unset-space-role.html) for a complete list of roles.
