# Task: Create a new space

Org managers can create spaces.

Run the following to create a new space:

```
cf create-space SPACE -o ORGNAME
```

where `SPACE` is the name of the space, and `ORGNAME` is the name of the org.

You can then add users to that space.

### Add users to a space

After a user has been added to an org, org managers can use the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) (requires sign in) to grant a user access to a space by assigning a role to that user.

1. Sign in to the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for either the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/).
1. Select the appropriate org.
1. Select __View and manage team members__.
1. Select __Invite a new team member__.
1. Complete the form and select __Send invitation__.


Alternatively, the org manager can run the following in the command line:

```
cf set-space-role USERNAME ORGNAME SPACE ROLE
```

where:

- `USERNAME` is the email address the user signs in with when using the command line client
- `ORGNAME` is the name of the org
- `SPACE` is the name of the space
- `ROLE` is the user role you are granting to the user of the email address in the `USERNAME` field

For example, to grant ana@example.com the space developer role in the test space within the acme org, the org manager would run:

```
cf set-space-role ana@example.com acme test SpaceDeveloper
```

Refer to the [Cloud Foundry reference guide on `cf set-space-role`](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/set-space-role.html) for a complete list of roles.
