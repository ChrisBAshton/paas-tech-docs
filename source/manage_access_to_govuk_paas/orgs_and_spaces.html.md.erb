# Organisations and Spaces

An organisation, or org, represents a group of users, applications and environments. Each org shares the same resource, quota and custom domain.

The GOV.UK PaaS team creates new orgs in the London region unless you request otherwise. We assign at least one [org manager](orgs_spaces_users.html#org-manager) to new orgs. You can request your first org on the [GOV.UK PaaS signup page](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/signup).

To request additional orgs, contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and tell us who the org manager(s) should be and the name of one of your existing orgs.

Run `cf orgs` to list the orgs your user account can access.

To see [quota](managing_apps.html#quotas) information about an org, you can select the appropriate org using the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) (requires sign in), and check the __Memory__ total in the top right corner of the screen. The amount of information you can see depends on your user role within the org. For example, org managers can see all quota information, whereas space developers can only see information on spaces that they are members of.

You can also run `cf org ORGNAME` to see [quota](managing_apps.html#quotas) information about an org, where `ORGNAME` is the name of the org.

Your user account will be initially assigned to one org by the PaaS team and then you can choose to belong to additional orgs. You can contact [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to request more orgs.

An org is divided into one or more spaces. A space is a shared location for developing, deploying and running apps and backing services.

For example, you might have separate spaces for the development and production versions of your app. When we set up your org, we create a default sandbox space you can use for experimenting with the PaaS.

To see the spaces you can access in your current org, you can either:

- run `cf spaces` in the command line
- sign in to the GOV.UK PaaS admin tool for either the [London region](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) or the [Ireland region](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) and select the appropriate org

[Org managers](orgs_spaces_users.html#org-manager) can create new spaces within an org.

Refer to the [case studies](orgs_spaces_users.html#case-studies) documentation for information on common structures for orgs, spaces and apps.

# Regions

The GOV.UK PaaS is hosted in 2 independent regions, London and Ireland.

GOV.UK PaaS accounts, credentials and resources belong to a single region.

If you have a London region account, your app domain is `APPNAME.london.cloudapps.digital`.

If you have an Ireland region account, your app domain is `APPNAME.cloudapps.digital`.
